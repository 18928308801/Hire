Connect is an open source point-to-point encryption instant messaging APP.

You can use Connect to send texts, voices, pictures, videos and even Bitcoin.
In both one-on-one chat and group chat, all the messages including text, picture, voices, video, etc. are sent via the shared key encryption negotiated by both sides of the chat. 
 
Any third party other than the both sides including the server can't decrypt the messages.
